## Challenges

### 1. Vending Machine

Create a `VendingMachine` class that simulates a simple vending machine. The machine holds a certain number of items, each with a fixed price.

- Users can buy items by specifying the number of items and inserting money.
- The machine should keep track of remaining items and return the correct change.
- If there are not enough items or insufficient money, appropriate errors or messages should be handled.

### 2. String Transformation

Write a function that transforms each word in a sentence based on the alphabetical comparison of consecutive characters.

- For each word, the first character remains unchanged.
- For every other character:
  - If it is alphabetically greater than the previous character, convert it to uppercase.
  - If it is alphabetically smaller, convert it to lowercase.
  - If it is the same, leave it unchanged.
- Return the transformed sentence as a single string.
